# BVB Funding Rate Dashboard

A funding rate monitoring dashboard for BVB ([Bull vs. Bear](https://bullbear.zone/)) markets on Neutron blockchain. Features automated data collection every 15 minutes, multiple timeframes, and comprehensive risk analysis. No wallet or whatsoever needed, just install and run.

> **Disclaimer**: This is a fan-made project. The author/maintainers have no affiliation with the BvB platform itself.

## Features

- üìä **Funding Rate Tracking**: Monitor funding rates across all BVB markets (updated every 15 minutes)
- üìà **Visualized Charts**: Dynamic funding rate and open interest visualization
- üö® **Risk Analysis**: Market sentiment, squeeze potential, and concentration risk metrics
- ‚ö° **Automated Data Collection**: Cron job fetches data every 15 minutes

## Architecture

### Data Collection

- **Update Frequency**: Data fetched every 15 minutes from BVB contracts
- **Data Source**: Neutron blockchain via CosmWasm queries

### Data Storage (MongoDB)

- **Database**: `dashboard`
- **Collections**:
  - `markets`: Stores market information (denom, display name)
  - `funding_rates`: Stores funding rate snapshots with timestamps

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

PM 2 (process manager)

```bash
npm install -g pm2  # For process management
```

MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

- Cloud (recommended): Use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) (free tier available)
- Local: Install [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

- _Note that You need to manually create a database named `dashboard` and two collections named `markets` and `funding_rates`_.

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# MongoDB connection string (required)
# For MongoDB Atlas:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<domain>/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<appName>

# Neutron RPC URL (optional - will use random public RPC if not set)
NEUTRON_RPC_URL=https://rpc-lb.neutron.org
```

### Development

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Start the cron scheduler with PM2 (production)
npm run cron:pm2
```

> **‚è∞ First Run Notice**: On your first run, there won't be enough historical data to display meaningful charts and analysis. Start the cron scheduler and wait a few hours to collect sufficient data points. The dashboard will show more insights as data accumulates over time.

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the application
npm start

# Start the cron scheduler with PM2
npm run cron:pm2
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run cron:pm2` - Start cron scheduler with PM2
- `npm run fetch-rates` - Manually fetch funding rates

## PM2 Management

```bash
# View running processes
pm2 list

# View logs
pm2 logs funding-rate-cron

# Restart process
pm2 restart funding-rate-cron

# Stop process
pm2 stop funding-rate-cron

# Delete process
pm2 delete funding-rate-cron
```

## Data Flow

1. **Cron Scheduler** (`scheduler.ts`) runs every 15 minutes
2. **Data Fetcher** (`fetchFundingRates.ts`) queries BVB contracts on Neutron
3. **MongoDB Storage** persists funding rates and market data to collections
4. **Dashboard** queries MongoDB and filters data based on selected timeframe
5. **Charts** display funding rates and open interest (15-minute intervals)

## Key Components

### Risk Analysis

- **Market Sentiment**: Overall market direction analysis
- **Squeeze Potential**: Identifies potential short/long squeezes
- **Concentration Risk**: Monitors open interest distribution
- **Funding Rate Alerts**: Automated threshold monitoring
- **Funding Rate Trend**: Tracks funding rates over time
- **Open Interest Analysis**: Visualizes open interest trends

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TailwindCSS
- **Database**: MongoDB with native Node.js driver
- **Blockchain**: CosmJS for Neutron integration
